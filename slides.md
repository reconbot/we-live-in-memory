> Redis is an **in-memory data structure store**, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries...

# [fit] Redis Is our Primary Data Store

- 1s fsync of AOF
- 1 hour snapshot RDB
- Read replicas ready to take over really fast
- Good enough for Bustle's read heavy load

# GraphDB

^ what if we had a database that let us save and access data like this?

> Databases like trains aren't slow, the queries like the passengers are slow.
-- Ikai (a DBA) who I guess never took the subway

^ > Trains are not slow they have one speed, people get on & off, the people are slow. Databases aren't slow they have one speed, data goes in and out, the queries are slow.


---

> They're complaining about the database being slow but it's their queries that are slow! They don't know how databases work! Where do they get off accusing the database servers!

---

## Some database are slow, some queries are slow, it's all about tradeoffs

---

# Bustle Traded Query Flexibility for Speed

^ and that's why we replicate from graphDB to BigQuery and elasticsearch

---

# No slow queries¬π

#[fit] Nodes, Edges, and Indexes

---

# Nodes (future)

- GUID (int32)
- Node Type
- `data` as a Compressed Protocol Buffer
- Redis Hash
`{ id, data, updateclock, ...metadata }`
- Update count with a Lua Script to prevent update clobbering

---

# Nodes (now)

- GUID (int32)
- Node Type
- `JSON.stringify()` fields
- Redis Hash
`{ id, ...data, ...metadata }`
- `HGETALL`, `HMSET`


---

# Node JSON

```js
{
  id: 1,
  _nodeType: 'User',
  name: 'Ein',
  bigDeal: true,
  createdAt: 1531334120311,
  updatedAt: 1531334113447
}

```


---
# Edges
[.build-lists: true]

- An edge is `Subject` -> `Predicate` -> `Object`
- An edge is `User` -> `UserHasPost` -> `Post`
- An edge can have weights
`User` -> `UserHasPost(42)` -> `Post`

---

# Edge JSON

```js
{
  subject: 5001,
  predicate: 'UserHasPost',
  object: 40238,
  weight: 42
}
```
---

# Sorted Sets

- Unique strings sorted by a score, then by member
- Think: hash with keys (members) sorted by their numeric values (scores) then by key
- Very fast read/write operations O(log(N))
- Can search by member or score

---

# Edges Hexastore

- 1 big Sorted Set with each edge in 6 orderings
- Pick an ordering and use `zrangebylex` to search

```
      ops:ObjectID:Predicate:SubjectID => 0
      osp:ObjectID:SubjectID:Predicate => 0
      pos:Predicate:ObjectID:SubjectID => 0
      pso:Predicate:SubjectID:ObjectID => 0
      sop:SubjectID:ObjectID:Predicate => 0
      spo:SubjectID:Predicate:ObjectID => 0
```

---

![](img/redis-cli-hexastore.png)

^ [ means get the matches inclusive, this is just SPO

---

# Edges Hexastore

- 6 big Sorted Sets one for each ordering
- 4 bytes === 32bit GUID
- 4 bytes === sha256(predicate).slice(0, 4)
- 12 Byte Binary packed key `SSSSPPPPOOOO`
- Binary Packing saved 70% of memory
- still use `zrangebylex` to searching the members

---

# Edges Weighted Store

- Can store a weight on an edge
- `Site -> HasPublishedPost(publishedAt) -> Post`
- Can only search `SP*` or `OP*`
- Can search ranges of weights (eg, posts published today)
- Lots of tiny Sorted Sets
- Faster because of the smaller "n" in `O(log(n))`

---
# Edges Weighted Store

Each edge is stored two different ways

```
Key                                | Member    | Score
"edge:s:${subjectId}:${predicate}" | objectId  | weight
"edge:o:${objectID}:${predicate}"  | subjectId | weight
```

---

![](img/weighted-store.png)

---

# Indexes

- `node:id` Sorted set of all node IDs
- `${type}:id` Sorted set of all node IDs of a type
- `${type}:${field}` Sorted set of unique values to ids

---

> How fast is it?
--Me

---

# Loading Nodes is fast

```js
while (true) {
  const start = Date.now()
  await graph.Site.find(1000001)
  console.log(`${Date.now() - start}ms`)
}
```
![right, fit](img/zeros.png)

^ It matters when you decide how to store your data layer, not really when you decide to use your data layer

---
# Loading all the nodes is fast

```js
while (true) {
  const start = Date.now()
  await Promise.all([
    graph.Site.find(1000001),
    graph.Post.find(8031264),
    graph.User.find(1910027),
    graph.Tag.find(1706155),
    graph.Tag.find(1706162),
    graph.Tag.find(2214803)
  ])
  console.log(`${Date.now() - start}ms`)
}

# In Conclusion

- Don't make slow queries possible
- Round trip time is a killer so batch your requests
- Store your data in a way that matches your access patterns
