I have an author, I even know her name, "Dale". But she's not why I'm here. Sure she wrote me, and did a fine job too if I don't say so myself. But every story here knows one thing. We exist to be read. If only I know who the readers were. I sure hope they're nice.
I have an author, her name is Dale. I have a title 
I'm sent from router to router, each one picking me up reading my address and putting me back down. I don't know how this is supposed to work but I hope I know where they're sending me!
My packets go from router to router, they copy me from one wire onto another. I get split up and put back together, and frankly it's not very pleasant. But at least it's over fast. I've arrived at the Lambda!
The lambda instances know the readers really well. I think they're friends or something. Right now I'm waiting in a queue, getting ready to be given to the request that asked for me. I can't wait! 
Before I know it I emerge from JSON.parse and I'm sitting in a post resolver.

We all lived in memory, at least that's what I was told. I don't know much about things like that. I do know a lot about "Dad Shoes". My author Dale took a fashion challenge to wear Dad Shoes for a week and while it was a rocky start, she's pretty sure she pulled them off. I have a few images and while I don't know what shoes are supposed to look like, I think she did a great job.
I haven't been read in a while, my createdAt is back a few months ago and while I got a lot of attention at first I don't get so much anymore. I wonder what happened? Maybe dad shoes aren't interesting anymore.
One day my boss Redis comes along and says "Hey Post 8031264 you're coming with me!"
Redis is really nice boss, no nonsense, reads me and gets out. They even put me here in memory when Dale was writing me. I'm told I started in a web browser, a bunch of components worked together to make me out of JSON and eventually I was given to Redis for safe keeping.
So off I go! A copy of me I guess, since I'm pretty sure I'm still in memory. I'm bundled up and sent down a socket onto the network. I'm bounced around a few routers and eventually I find my host! Their name is Lambda and they are odd looking. for some reason.

- Use a time of a total stranger so they will feel that their time was not wasted
- Give the reader at least one character they can relate to
- Every character should want something (even a glass of water)
- Every sentence should reveal character or advance the action
- Start as close to the end as possible
- Be a sadist, no mater how sweet the character is make awful things happen to them
- Write for an audience of one person
- Give your readers as much information as soon as possible, no suspense, they should be able to finish the story themselves
